## reminder-for-desktop

# This is a small Visual Basics script I have done in order to get more familiar with the language.
    reminder.vbs creates the message box that pops when you run the script, with 2 options: yes and no. Each option then displays a different message. I automated the script to run daily at a set hour using Task Scheduler, but there was also the option to use another script (which I began writing but it is just a little more than a sketch now).
